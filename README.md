🎓 Student Performance Prediction – AI/ML Internship Project (Week 2)
This project was completed as part of my AI & ML Internship with NSP NEXUS.
It involves building a logistic regression model to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on two key features:  
📚 Hours Studied and 🏫 Attendance Percentage.

🔍 One-Line Description  
A machine learning model built in Python using Google Colab that predicts a student’s pass/fail outcome from their study hours and attendance.

📌 Project Overview  
This notebook-based project demonstrates a binary classification task using logistic regression.  
The model uses a simple, small dataset with the following columns:
- Hours_Studied  
- Attendance (%)  
- Pass/Fail (1 = Pass, 0 = Fail)
The model is trained to classify whether a student will pass or fail based on their study habits and attendance.

🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand binary classification using Logistic Regression  
- Create and explore a dataset using pandas  
- Visualize the data using matplotlib  
- Train and test a logistic regression model using scikit-learn  
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy score  
- Predict pass/fail for custom input values

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Google Colab (Notebook)  
- Python  
- Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn

🧪 Sample Dataset
| Hours_Studied | Attendance (%) | Pass/Fail |
|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| 5             | 85             | 1         |
| 2             | 60             | 0         |
| 4             | 75             | 1         |
| 1             | 50             | 0         |

✅ Features Implemented
- Manual dataset creation and loading  
- Data exploration using simple visualizations  
- Data preprocessing and train-test split  
- Logistic Regression model training  
- Accuracy evaluation  
- Custom user input support for prediction

📎 How to Use This Notebook
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab  
2. Run each cell in order  
3. In the “User Input Section”, provide:  
   - Hours Studied (e.g., 4.5)  
   - Attendance Percentage (e.g., 80)  
4. View the predicted result: Pass (1) or Fail (0)
